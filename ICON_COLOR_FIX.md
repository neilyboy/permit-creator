# Icon Color Fix - PDF Export

## Problem
MDI icons were appearing desaturated/faded in PDF exports, not matching the vibrant colors shown in the legend.

**Why?**
- Icons were captured by `html2canvas` along with the base map
- Entire canvas (including icons) was then desaturated  
- Result: Faded icons that didn't match legend colors

## Solution
**Two-pass capture strategy:**

### Pass 1: Capture Full-Color Icons
```javascript
// Hide overlays, make tiles nearly invisible
overlayPane.style.display = 'none';
tilePane.style.opacity = '0.05';

// Capture ONLY markers with full vibrant colors
html2canvas(map, { backgroundColor: null })
```

### Pass 2: Capture Base Map for Desaturation
```javascript
// Hide markers, show overlays and tiles
markerPane.style.display = 'none';

// Capture base map + shapes for desaturation
html2canvas(map)
```

### Compositing
```javascript
1. Draw base canvas
2. Desaturate (map tiles become muted)
3. Draw shapes with vibrant colors
4. Composite full-color marker canvas on top ✨
```

## Result

**Layer Order (bottom to top):**
1. Desaturated base map tiles
2. Vibrant shapes (polylines, circles, polygons)
3. **Vibrant icons** (full color, matches legend!)
4. Text labels

## Technical Details

### Why Two Captures?
- Can't selectively desaturate pixels
- Need icons separate from base map
- Markers captured first preserve full color
- Base map captured separately for desaturation

### Marker Canvas
- Captured with `backgroundColor: null` (transparent)
- Contains ONLY icons and text markers
- Preserved at full color/saturation
- Composited last for perfect fidelity

### Opacity Trick
- Tiles set to 5% opacity during marker capture
- Provides faint reference for positioning
- Doesn't pollute the marker colors
- Restored to 100% for base capture

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- Icons captured with base map ❌
- Icons desaturated along with tiles ❌
- Faded colors don't match legend ❌
- Result: Confusing, unprofessional ❌

### After:
- Icons captured separately ✅
- Icons keep full vibrant colors ✅
- Colors match legend perfectly ✅
- Result: Professional, clear ✅

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Add MDI icons in bright colors (red, blue, green, etc.)
2. Add shapes in same colors
3. Create legend with those colors
4. Export to PDF
5. Zoom in on icons
6. **Verify:** Icons should be vibrant and match legend colors!

## Benefits

✅ **Icon colors match legend** - Perfect consistency  
✅ **Professional appearance** - Vibrant, clear icons  
✅ **Rotation & scale preserved** - Full transformation support  
✅ **Text labels preserved** - Drawn with full color  
✅ **No manual workarounds** - Automatic, seamless

**Status:** Fixed and tested!  
**Date:** Oct 17, 2025  
**Impact:** Icons now export with full vibrant colors matching the legend!
