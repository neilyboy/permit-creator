# PDF Export Fix - Double Line Issue

## Problem
Lines appeared thicker or doubled in PDF exports because they were being drawn twice:
1. First by Leaflet on the map (captured by html2canvas)
2. Then again by our custom canvas drawing code

## Root Cause
The PDF generation code was:
1. Capturing the entire map with `html2canvas` (including all drawn lines)
2. Then drawing all the lines again on top using canvas API
3. Result: Lines appeared doubled/thicker

## Solution
**Fixed by properly hiding the overlay pane during capture:**

```javascript
// Hide ALL drawing overlays (but keep map tiles visible)
const overlayPane = document.querySelector('.leaflet-overlay-pane');
if (overlayPane) overlayPane.style.display = 'none';

// Capture clean base map
html2canvas(document.getElementById('map'), { ... })
    .then(baseCanvas => {
        // Restore overlay
        if (overlayPane) overlayPane.style.display = overlayStyle || '';
        
        // Now draw our layers cleanly on top
        layers.forEach(layerObj => {
            // Draw polylines, polygons, circles, etc.
        });
    });
```

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Better Line Rendering
Added proper canvas line settings for smoother, professional lines:
```javascript
ctx.lineCap = 'round';    // Smooth line ends
ctx.lineJoin = 'round';   // Smooth corners/joints
```

### 2. Text & Icon Support
Added proper handling for text and icon markers in PDF export:
- Text markers rendered with correct font, size, color
- Icon markers captured by html2canvas (includes rotation & scale)

## What Changed

### Before:
- Lines captured by html2canvas **+** Lines drawn by canvas = **Double lines**
- Sharp corners on lines
- No text/icon rendering support
- Thick drawn lines (3px)
- Footer divider lines overlapping corners

### After:
- Overlay hidden during capture = Clean base map
- Lines drawn once with proper styling
- Smooth, round line caps and joins
- Text and icons properly rendered
- **Lines scaled to 75%** (2.25px instead of 3px)
- **Footer dividers inset** by 0.005" to prevent corner overlap
- **Single, clean lines in PDF!**

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Draw some polylines (straight lines, multi-point lines)
2. Draw shapes (circles, rectangles, polygons)
3. Add text and icons
4. Export to PDF
5. Check that lines are single thickness, not doubled
6. Verify smooth corners and clean rendering

## Impact

✅ **Fixed:** Double/thick line issue in PDF exports  
✅ **Improved:** Line rendering quality (smooth caps/joins)  
✅ **Enhanced:** Text and icon support in PDFs  
✅ **Result:** Professional, clean PDF output!
